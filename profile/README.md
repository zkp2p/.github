# ZKP2P
This is the official organization for ZKP2P, created and maintained by [richardzliang](https://twitter.com/richardzliang), [0xSachinK](https://twitter.com/0xSachinK), [Bmwball56](https://twitter.com/Bmwball56), and [asoong](https://twitter.com/asoong91). We are currently focused on ZKP2P v2 which is a productionized version of a previous hackathon [submission](https://github.com/zkp2p/zk-p2p-v1) that we now refer to as v1 and are supported by the Privacy and Scaling Exploration ([PSE](https://www.appliedzkp.org/projects/zkp2p)) group of the Ethereum Foundation through grants, development collaboration, and audits.

V1 (PoC) is live on Optimism and Goerli, try it out at [zkp2p.xyz](https://zkp2p.xyz/). See the [repo](https://github.com/zkp2p/zk-p2p-v1) and [demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CaPoVMrZUEuvsFhXLLI9D1wUXevqSwkT/view?usp=drive_link) for usage tips.
