# ZKP2P
This is the official organization for ZKP2P, created and maintained by [richardzliang](https://twitter.com/richardzliang), [0xSachinK](https://twitter.com/0xSachinK), [Bmwball56](https://twitter.com/Bmwball56), and [asoong](https://twitter.com/asoong91). We are currently focused on ZKP2P v2 which is a productionized version of a previous hackathon [submission](https://github.com/zkp2p/zk-p2p-v1) that we now refer to as v1 and are supported by the Privacy and Scaling Exploration (PSE) group of the Ethereum Foundation through grants, development collaboration, and audits.
